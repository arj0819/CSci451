HW-8	CSci-451	20 points		Due: Octoberray 29, 2018 

This assignment is to honor the Zucca Gigantopithecus (great pumpkin), 
who flies through the air on Halloween night delivering homework solutions 
to computer science students throughout the world. Of course, he only 
visits the most sincere computer science students, the rest have to 
complete their own assignments. How sincere are you?

Program 1 
---------
Program 1 will read a text file called "input.data" and extract the 
words. Note that words will be separated only by spaces. Commas, periods,
etc will be considered part of a word. As each word is extracted, 
program 1 will write the words (1 word per line) out to a temporary 
file called temp1.data. For example:
 
input.data:
	It is the Zucca Gigantopithecus, or Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. 

temp1.data:
	It 
	is 
	the 
	Zucca 
	Gigantopithecus, 
	or
	Great 
	Pumpkin, 
	Charlie 
	Brown.

Note that all punctuation marks will remain attached to their words (only
spaces separate words).

Program 2
---------
Program 2 will read temp1.data and convert each word into Pig Latin 
(rules shown below) and write the converted word to another temp file 
(call it temp2.data) with 1 word per line. Program 2 will also keep track 
of how many words of each form (2 types possible) were converted and write
those values to 2 other files (call them shared1.dat and shared2.dat). For
example:

temp1.data:
	It 
	is 
	the 
	Zucca 
	Gigantopithecus, 
	or
	Great 
	Pumpkin, 
	Charlie 
	Brown.

temp2.data:
	Itray 
	isray 
	hetay 
	uccaZay 
	igantopithecusGay, 
	orray
	reatGay
	umpkinPay, 
	harlieCay 
	rownBay.

shared1.dat:
	3

shared2.dat:
	7

Pig Latin rules:
1) Type 1: For all words beginning with a vowel add the text "ray" to the 
end of the word. For example: "and" becomes "andray," "end" becomes "endray", 
etc. Note that any punctuation marks must remain at the end of the newly 
formed word.

2) Type 2: For all words beginning with consonants move the first letter to 
the end of the word and add "ay". For example "number" becomes "umbernay," 
"letter" becomes "etterlay," etc. Note that any punctuation marks must 
remain at the end of the newly formed word.

Program 3
---------
Program 3 will open shared1.dat and shared2.dat files and display the values 
contained on the screen using the format:
	Type 1: word_count
	Type 2: word_count

Program 3 will also open temp2.data and reconstruct the original document 
(multiple words per line) and write it out to temp3.data. For example:

temp2.data:
	Itray 
	isray 
	hetay 
	uccaZay 
	igantopithecusGay, 
	orray
	reatGay
	umpkinPay, 
	harlieCay 
	rownBay.

temp3.data:
	Itray isray hetay uccaZay igantopithecusGay, orray reatGay umpkinPay, 
	harlieCay rownBay.

I suggest you look into the lower level C functions for reading and writing files
(see the UNIX System calls handout) as you will need these for future revisions.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Mint.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be in a tarball named hw8-yourname.tar
