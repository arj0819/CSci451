HW-1	CS451	10 points	Due: Monday. 8/27/2018

Create a C/C++ program that will handle as many as 4 command-line 
arguments. Each argument will consist of a UNIX command with any 
appropriate syntax that will then be executed with the "system" 
system call. Any output resulting from a "system" call must be 
written to an output file.

For example: ./hw1 ls *.cpp

Which would perform the same as "ls *.cpp >> output.txt"


Requirements:
1. Select UNIX commands that will report the current date/time 
   (date), current user (who am i), user processes list (ps), 
   and user disk quota (quota).

2. All output must be written to "output.txt".

3. Turn in your source code, "output.txt", and the command-line that 
   is used to execute your program.

* See the unix "man" pages on system - i.e. "man system" - for info on the 
system command.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Linux Mint.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw1-yourname.c
