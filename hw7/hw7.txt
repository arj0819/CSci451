RAID - Kills hard drives dead.

For this assignment you will write a program that simulates a 5-disk RAID 
system. There will be five files (each a simulation of a drive) that contain 
character-stripped data. These files are names as follows:
   drive1.data
   drive2.data
   drive3.data
   drive4.data
   drive5.data

drive1.data will contain characters, for example:
   16af

drive2.data will contain characters, for example:
   27bg

drive3.data will contain characters, for example:
   38ch

drive4.data will contain characters, for example:
   49di

drive5.data will contain characters, for example:
   50ej

Your main program must spawn 5 threads, where each thread will read from 
one hard drive (thread 1 reads from drive1.data, etc). These threads must 
be "detached" and free to read data as they wish. As a thread reads a 
character from a drive (data MUST be read character by character) it must 
pass that datum (character) back to the main program. The main program 
then must assemble the stripped data into a single block of data.

Once all of the data has been read in the main program must display
the assembled block of data. So for the above example you would display:

   1234567890abcdefghij

CAVEATS:
--------
1. You do not know how big the data files will be, but they will 
be of equal size. There will not be blank spaces in the data files.

2. Since the threads are detached, you will need to devise some method
to synchronize them or synchronize the data. You must use a mutex as a 
counting semaphore would make this too easy.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Mint.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw8-yourname.c or hw8-yourname.cpp
