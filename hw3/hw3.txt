HW-3		CS451	20 points	Due: Monday. 9/17/2018

Create a program uses "system" to call "WGET" to download the file 
(http://undcemcs01.und.edu/~ronald.marsh/CLASS/CS451/hw3-data.txt). 

The program must then open and load the file into a character array. 
However, you must assume that you do not know the size of the 
hw3-data.txt file in advance (its size will change when we tests on your 
program). Therefore, your program must somehow determine the size of 
the file, create a dynamic array large enough, and load the data into 
the array. As you load the array it would be wise to also convert all 
uppercase characters to lowercase at this time. 

Once you have the array populated create 2 threads (see UNIX notes on
website). One thread must search for all occurences of the word "Easy".
The second thread must search for all occurences of the word "Polar".
Both threads must also display the number of occurences of each word.

* Don't forget to delete the dynamic array once you no longer need it.

* While you could do this assignment without threads, doing so will 
  cost you at least 15 points.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Mint.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw3-yourname.c or hw3-yourname.cpp
